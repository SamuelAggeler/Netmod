## Introduction

In this assignment we are going to analyze the ties among 11 year old pupils when it comes to supporting each other during hard times.We want to see whether following hypothesis are supported by our model :
1. Are pupils more likely to support someone that also supported them.
2. Are pupil with the same gender more likely to support each other.

```{r}
library(sna)
library(network)
setwd("data/support/")

support <- as.matrix(read.csv("support.csv", header = FALSE))
attributes <- as.matrix(read.csv("attributes.csv"))
```




This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
